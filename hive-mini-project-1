1. Create a schema based on the given dataset

create external table agent_performance
(
Sno int,
Date string,
agent_name string,
total_chats int,
avg_response_time string,
avg_resolution_time string,
avg_rating float,
total_feedback int
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ","
tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1")

load data inpath '/user/cloudera/hive_class/mini_proj_1/agentperformance/AgentPerformance.csv' into table agent_performance

create external table agent_loging_report
(
Sno int,
agent_name string,
Date date,
login_time string,
logout_time string,
duration string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ","
tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1")

load data inpath '/user/cloudera/hive_class/mini_proj_1/agentlogingreport/AgentLogingReport.csv' into table agent_loging_report

        

2. Dump the data inside the hdfs in the given schema location.
        $ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /tmp/AgentPerformance.csv hive_class/mini_proj_1/agentperformance
        $ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /tmp/AgentLogingReport.csv hive_class/mini_proj_1/agentlogingreport

3. List of all agents' names. 
        SELECT DISTINCT agent_name FROM agent_performance ;
               
4. Find out agent average rating.
        SELECT agent_name, avg(avg_rating) as agent_avg_rating FROM agent_performance group by agent_name
        
5. Total working days for each agents 
        SELECT agent_name, count(date) as total_working_days FROM agent_performance group by agent_name
                
6. Total query that each agent have taken 
        SELECT agent_name, sum(total_chats) as total_queries_taken FROM agent_performance group by agent_name        
        
7. Total Feedback that each agent have received 
        SELECT agent_name, sum(total_feedback) as total_feedbacks_received FROM agent_performance group by agent_name
        
8. Agent name who have average rating between 3.5 to 4 
        SELECT distinct agent_name  FROM agent_performance where avg_rating  BETWEEN 3.5 and 4
        
9. Agent name who have rating less than 3.5 
        SELECT distinct agent_name  FROM agent_performance where avg_rating  < 3.5

10. Agent name who have rating more than 4.5 
        SELECT distinct agent_name  FROM agent_performance where avg_rating  > 4.5
        
11. How many feedback agents have received more than 4.5 average
        SELECT agent_name ,count(total_feedback) as no_of_feedback   FROM agent_performance 
        group by agent_name, avg_rating having avg_rating > 4.5

12. average weekly response time for each agent 
        select agent_name, avg(col1[0]*60+col1[1]+col1[2]/60) as agent_avg_response_time
        from ( select agent_name ,split(avg_response_time,':') as col1 from agent_performance )abc
        group by agent_name
        order by  agent_avg_response_time DESC
        
13. average weekly resolution time for each agents 
         select agent_name, avg(col1[0]*60+col1[1]+col1[2]/60) as agent_avg_resolution_time_in_minitues 
        from ( select agent_name ,split(avg_resolution_time,':') as col1 from agent_performance )abc 
        group by agent_name 
        order by agent_avg_resolution_time_in_minitues DESC 

14. Find the number of chat on which they have received a feedback 
        select agent_name, sum(total_chats) as no_of_chats from (select * from agent_performance where total_feedback > 0)abc
        group by agent_name

15. Total contribution hour for each and every agents weekly basis 
        select s.agent_name, sum(col1[0]+(col1[1]/60)+(col1[2]/3600)),s.weekly 
        from (select agent_name , split(duration ,':') as col1 , weekofyear(Date) as weekly from agent_loging_report)s
        group by s.agent_name, s.weekly

16. Perform inner join, left join and right join based on the agent column and after joining the table export that data into your local system.
17. Perform partitioning on top of the agent column and then on top of that perform bucketing for each partitioning.
